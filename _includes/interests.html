                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Security and privacy</strong>.
                        I'm very keen to do what I can to improve the security and privacy of netizens.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Adventure trips</strong>. I enjoy cycling, hiking and camping in
                        remote places around the world. I occasionally upload photos to
                        <a href="https://www.flickr.com/people/gus_adventures/">my Flickr account</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Bicycle maintenance</strong>. This started out of necessity in preparation for a remote
                        tour, but I enjoyed it and now I have my own workshop at home.

                        I built <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/pyrecord/">PyRecord</a> to bring record types to
                        Python, inspired by the implementation in my favourite language (Ada).

                        I made a business out of my first web app at the age of 17 and learned many lessons the hard
                        way. It reached profitability quite quickly, but it only lasted six months.

                        I've spoken at EuroPython, Django Users Group in London and Libre Software Meeting (RMLL),
