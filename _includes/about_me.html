                    I have 12+ years of experience as back-end engineer, team lead and ScrumMaster. I enjoy solving
                    inherently difficult problems as part of a self-managed team.
                </p>

                    I'm currently on a short sabbatical to finish my software engineering master at Oxford,
                    but I'm also keen to consider back-end roles where I can start in early 2019.

                <p>
                    I prefer statically typed languages and relational DBs, but I'd happily work with just
                    about any modern tech â€“ The product and the people behind it are far more important to me.
