                    I have 12+ years of experience as back-end engineer, team lead and ScrumMaster. I enjoy solving
                    inherently difficult problems as part of a self-managed team.

                    I founded <a href="https://relaycorp.tech">Relaycorp</a> in Q1 2019 to support the development of

                    >Relaynet</a>, a new computer network that will keep people connected despite Internet blackouts or
                    natural disasters.
